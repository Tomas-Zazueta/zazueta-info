Welcome to zazueta.info - the world's first website dedicated to best last name in the world: Zazueta! I am Tomas Zazueta, and I hope you and any vistors find my site useful.

# So what IS a Zazueta, anyway?
**Zazueta** is a surname that originated from the **Basque Country** in Spain. This region is best known for using the Basque/Euskara language, which predates any other Indo-European language in the region. This means that **Zazueta** isn't actually Spanish!

The name may have been originally spelled as **Sasoeta**, which was derived from **Lasarte**. Respect to the classics, but I like our version best!

# How exactly do you pronounce Zazueta?
In English: **ZA-ZWE-tuh**
In Spanish: **ZA-ZWE-tah**
