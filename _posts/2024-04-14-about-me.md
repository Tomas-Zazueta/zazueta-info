Hi! I am a programmer/nerd looking to better my community and the world around us.

I went to HS at Don Bosco Tech, where I first learned to code. 

I went to college at UC Irvine, graduating with a BS in Computer Science.

Most importantly, I am part of a very exclusive club - people with **Zazueta** surnames.

I have 5 years of experience in the tech field, focusing on Data Management & Analysis. I am currently working for the [UC Irvine Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders](https://mind.uci.edu/).

Thanks for visting my site! I hope you enjoyed it. You can find me at [tomasjustinzazueta@gmail.com](mailto:tomasjustinzazueta@gmail.com)
