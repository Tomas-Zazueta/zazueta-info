*NOTE: This post is from my old WordPress archive. I first started blogging after graduating High School. I thought it would be a good idea to preserve some of these articles here.*

Well, then. I never thought I’d get around to making one of these blogs. Not because I never had anything to say, but because I never had the time to say it.

But school’s out, so that changes things. I’m not exactly sure what I’ll talk about on here, but I will try to focus on things that I think matters to me. If that happens to be what my current hobby is or what I’m going through in life, so be it.

Well, I do hope that you’ll be able to take something out of what I put on here, reader. If you find my blog posts entertaining or educational, which isn’t my primary aim, that’s cool. While I’m doing this for myself, it’s nice to think that I can be of benefit to others.

So there you have it. Consider it a sort of mission statement. I’ll be updating this place periodically with what I deem worthwhile in the months ahead.
